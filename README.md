# 3RD PERSON MOD

WARNING - BEFORE YOU INSTALL
Before putting the files into your main/mainta/maintt folder: backup your original gamex86.dll file in that folder! You must keep it for uninstalling this mod.

## 1. What is it?

These files ("ZzZzZzZ-3rd-person-mod.pk3" and "gamex86.dll") allow you to create your own, cheat-free, basically tweeked 3rd-person server.
So, on the server you create, players will see themselves running in 3rd person view, while cheating has been disabled, which is an issue on many 3rd person servers I used to play on.

Also, various tweeks have been added by me, because I liked them on my own server. Tweeks such as:

- Rocket launchers firing smoke grenades
- Added silenced pistols
- Holstered weapons on the back
- Elaborated voting menu
- More ammo
- Tracer bullets on some weapons

And, to make it look more professional, I have not included any credits for me in-game, so you can impress people, telling that you made the mod yourself ;)

## 2. Issues and problems

* This mod has only been tested in Spearhead. I can't guarantee that it will work in standard MoH, or in Breakthrough.

* Objectvie and Tug of War mode will not work, that is, you cannot fulfill the objectives.
I could not resolve this, since enabling these game modes would activate the spawn-command, thus enabling players to spawn objects wherever they want.

* Only standard MoH and Spearhead maps are supported. Breakthrough and custom maps will remain in 1st person view.

## 3. Installing

WARNING: DO NOT FORGET TO BACKUP gamex86.dll! I suggest that you make a new map called "ORIGINAL GAMEX86" into your main/mainta/maintt folder, and move the original gamex86.dll to that folder.

To install this mod for standard MoH, put "ZzZzZzZ-3rd-person-mod.pk3" and "gamex86.dll" into this folder:
C:\Program Files\EA GAMES\MOHAA\main

For Spearhead, put them here:
C:\Program Files\EA GAMES\MOHAA\mainta

For Breakthrough:
C:\Program Files\EA GAMES\MOHAA\maintt

GENERAL INFORMATION: if you want to create an online server from your home, you need to open TCP and UDP ports on your router, or people will not be able to join.
To know which ports to open and how to open them, use Google (or Bing or Yahoo Search or ...)
